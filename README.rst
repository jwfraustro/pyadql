** pyadql **

PyADQL is a work-in-progress Python library for parsing and manipulating ADQL. This is a very rough early version, with minimal features besides parsing.

Requirements can be installed with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The adql string to be parsed is hard-coded in the `adql_parser.py` file, and can be changed to any valid ADQL query. Results may vary. Output will be displayed as a parse tree in PNG form.
